## Example
* Who: College Student
* User Story: As a student with several classes and some extracurriculars, I want to be able to keep track of my progress on my tasks across each activity. This way, I will be able to focus on higher priority tasks and be able to get a clear view of how much I still need to get done.I also have a lot of distractions which cause me to procrastinate on my tasks, so I need a tool to help me focus and minimize distractions while I work.
