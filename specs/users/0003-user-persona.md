## User Persona 3

* Pain Points: Used to getting work done at coffee shops pre-COVID, but all coffee shops in my area have closed down. I miss being able to switch my place of work and mindset quickly by just going down to local coffee shop.
This has affected my creativitiy and ability to work for extended periods of time.

* Strategy: our website creates a coffee-shop-like environment with minimal clutter to bring about the new-environment feeling and maximizes productivity through a simple Pomodoro timer.
