## Project Roadmap

### Step 1: Brainstorm, Design, Prototype

Tasks:
* User Centered Thinking Documents
* Wireframing
* System Diagrams - how will app be decomposed?
* Build personas, user stories
* Document intial design decisions
* Setup repo and testing environment

Goal: Simple and clean interface, practice meeting deadlines

### Step 2: Build MVP

Tasks (key features to be implemented):
* An accurate timer
* User fills in time they want to work for and how much time they want to rest (estimation)
* Start and stop buttons (no pause/resume)
* Looping multiple short breaks followed by long break
* Add, edit, and select tasks to work on
* Audio/visual notification at end of sessions
* One click start

Goal: Make sure we have working individual features and overall basic product

### Step 3: Test MVP

Tasks:
* Check whether each feature works correctly
* Evaluate Pomodoro as an entire app
* Go back to fix any issues/compensate for unsatisfactory quality
* Test platform compatibility
* Have friends/families test?

Goal: Try to make it break and evaluate user reception

### Step 4: Add Additional Features Phase 1

Tasks (key extra features to be implemented):
* Checklist with history of saved sessions
* Activity log and statistics
* Change theme, dark mode, light mode
* Point/Karma system: gain points for finishing tasks and lose points for resetting
* When stop clicked, are you sure popup
* Autoplay based on user inputted tasks
* Keyboard commands
* Customize alarm sounds for end of a session
* Recommending other apps/websites to use alongside ours

Goal: Based on user reception in step 3, add additional features as time permits to fit needs while maintaing simplicity of web app

### Step 5: Test Additional Features and Future

Tasks:
* Follow steps similar to step 3
* Look into monetization
* Look into additional features below
  * Provide recommendation for better study time
  * API integration
  * GCal / other todo list app integration
  * Visualization of workflow throughout a weeks/months

Goal: test market adoption and optomize app
