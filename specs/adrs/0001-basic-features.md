# Basic Features
## Context and Problem Statement
After brainstorming several ideas to include in our website, which features are going to be in our minimum viable product?

## Considered Options

* An accurate timer
* User fills in time they want to work for and how much time they want to rest (estimation)
* Start and stop buttons (no pause/resume)
* Looping multiple short breaks followed by long break
* Add, edit, and select tasks to work on
* Audio/visual notification at end of sessions
* One click start

* Checklist with history of saved sessions
* Activity log and statistics
* Change theme, dark mode, light mode
* Point/Karma system: gain points for finishing tasks and lose points for resetting
* When stop clicked, are you sure popup
* Autoplay based on user inputted tasks
* Keyboard commands
* API integration
* Recommending other apps/websites to use alongside ours

## Decision Outcome

Chosen options: first seven features, because it's essential to narrow down to the most important features implementable within the given development period of 2 weeks. 
These features allow us to focus on the priciples of the Pomodoro methodology while keeping the project under control
