# Remove Estimate Pomodoros Feature

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: Jessica, Annie, Vishaal
* Date: 2021-02-23

## Context and Problem Statement

After we completed the MVP, we wanted to add the Estimate Pomodoros Feature. However, after the shift towards increased testing, we decided not to focus on this feature currently.
If we are able to finish fully testing and integrating what we currently have, then we may be able to focus including this feature again.

## Decision Drivers

* Original Pomodoro method has users estimating Pomos for comparison between actual and estimated
* The hard shift towards making sure the MVP is clean and fully tested

## Considered Options

* Allow users to estimate pomodoros and allow them to edit that estimation
* Allow users to estimate once but not edit
* Don't have the estimate pomodoros feature at all

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Don't have the estimate pomodoros feature at all", because we decided we need to focus on testing our MVP first before trying to add more features, which may or may not improve our overall product.

### Positive Consequences

* Can focus on testing the MVP
* Don't have to worry about design issues for including this feature

### Negative Consequences

* The product won't exactly fully reflect the Pomodoro Technique

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Allow users to estimate pomodoros and allow them to edit that estimation

* Good, because follows the Pomodoro Technique
* Good, because if the user mistakenly submits a wrong estimate, they can edit it
* Bad, because designing the feature that allows users to estimate and edit Pomos is difficult
* Bad, because takes our attention away from testing

### Allow users to estimate once but not edit

* Good, because follows the Pomodoro Technique
* Good, because designing the feature that allows users to edit Pomos is difficult
* Bad, because if the user mistakenly submits a wrong estimate, they can't edit it
* Bad, because takes our attention away from testing

### Don't have the estimate pomodoros feature at all

* Good, because we can focus our time on cleaning up the MVP and doing testing
* Good, because we don't have to worry about the design for this feature
* Bad, because we don't fully reflect the Pomodoro Technique
