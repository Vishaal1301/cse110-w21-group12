# Website will have a Coffee Shop theme

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: Jessica, Gary, Annie, Vishaal
* Date: 2021-02-03

## Context and Problem Statement

There a many pomodoro timers on the market that work great. So, how do we differentiate our product from all of the rest? Which niche should we narrow down on to make our product unique from those already available?

## Decision Drivers

* Original design is too similar to an application called Momentum
* Some of the groups that presented during the morning discussion had more unique designs compared to us

## Considered Options

* Leaving theme as is - like Momentum
* Gear towards people with difficulty focusing due to ADHD, etc. - use calming colors and animations
* Anime themed / Video breaks - showing videos or anime during breaks
* Gear toward Leetcoders - link leetcode problems to do during the focus periods
* Coffee shop themed - play coffee shop sounds and create a 'coffee-shop-like' environment

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Coffee shop themed", because
* The other options added complications that weren't worth their benefits.
* This niche is one that our group, as college students, can relate to. This will make it easier for us to tailor our product toward a group we're familiar with.
* Several of us used to go to coffee shops to study and do homework pre-pandemic but, now that this is no longer safe, we decided our product could 'bring the cafe to us'. This defines a customer need.
* This also gives a unique twist on our pomodoro timer and also improves our product since [research](https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/21/how-the-hum-of-a-coffee-shop-can-boost-creativity/?_r=0) has shown the benefits of [ambient noise](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/665048?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) to productivity and creativity.

### Positive Consequences

* Gives a unique direction for design
* Targets and satisfies a possible consumer need.

### Negative Consequences

* We could get too narrow and block out valid consumers
* We can easily get too caught up in design decisions

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Leaving theme as is - like Momentum

* Good, because clean and simple
* Good, because already mocked-up in Figma
* Bad, because not unique at all

### Gear towards people with difficulty focusing due to ADHD, etc. - use calming colors and animations

* Good, because creates a niche target audience
* Good, because has the potential to be helpful
* Bad, because our group members aren't a part of this target audience thus might have difficulty understanding how best to help

### Anime themed / Video breaks - showing videos or anime during breaks

* Good, because it's fun and interesting
* Bad, because would be difficult to implement (i.e. videos might be too long for the short 5min breaks, how would we deal with that?)

### Gear toward Leetcoders - link leetcode problems to do during the focus periods

* Good, because it would be helpful
* Good, because we fit the target audience
* Bad, because it would be difficult to implement (i.e. how do we determine which problems to give the user)

### Coffee shop themed - play coffee shop sounds and create a 'coffee-shop-like' environment

* Good, because it targets a specific but relatively large target audience
* Good, because would be helpful especially during the pandemic
* Good, because is based on design rather than difficult implementations
* Bad, because it might block off some users (outside of our target audience) from using our website
