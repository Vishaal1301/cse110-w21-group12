## Context and Problem Statement

To make our Pomodoro web app unique, we wanted to implement a 'setting' feature that lets the user customize the web app. 
We face the problem of choosing the UI of the 'setting' button.

## Considered Options

* A gear icon
* Three horizontal dots
* Three vertical dots

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Three vertical dots" because it fits our theme the best.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Our Pomodoro timer supports user customizations

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Gear Icon

* Bad, because it doesn't fit our theme

### Three horizontal dots

* Good, because it fits our theme

### Three vertical dots

* Good, because it fits our theme
* Good, because it fits the overall design
* it remains simple and non-distracting
