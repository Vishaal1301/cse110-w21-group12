## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Add the notification sound

* Good, because it will give the user a better user experience
* Bad, because we will need to write extra code and unit tests

### Don't add the notification sound

* Good, because we don't need to write extra code and unit tests since we almost 100% test coverage
* Good, because we don't need to spend extra time to manual test this new feature
* Bad, because our app has one less feature
