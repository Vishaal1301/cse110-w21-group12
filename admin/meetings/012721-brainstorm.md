### Decisions/Points Discussed

_Agreed on the principles of the Pomodoro technique:_
- Step 1: choose task(s)
- Step 2: run Pomodoro timer for 25 mins
- Step 3: 5-minute break between sessions
- Step 4: every 4 sessions, 20-minute break

_Build a Minimum Viable Product first:_
- The MVP will only include features essential for an operating Pomodoro timer
  - these include: 
    - An accurate timer
    - User-inputted task list or total num of work-hours
    - Start and Stop button (no pause)
    - An operating short-break, long-break mechanism
    - Audio (preset ringtone)/visual notification after every session
    - One-click start - include ability to get into web-page and quickly start a session
    - Preset light/dark theme
- Debate: should we include autoplay feature based on user-inputted tasks in MVP?
  - Not essential for MVP b/c looping based on several tasks would sacrifice quick adoption
  - User would have input several tasks manually or we would have to include option to import tasks 
  - Importing tasks from Google Calendar or some other place would not be an MVP feature

_Would our product be an app/web-page/chrome-extension? Web-page:_
- Start with web-page b/c
  - Team have more knowledge with webdev 
  - So team will be able to meet timelines quicker

_Mood/Theme:_
- Designed for college students
- Work quickly without setup 
- Maximize efficiency
- light-hearted wording

_Ideas from Competitors:_
- Start
