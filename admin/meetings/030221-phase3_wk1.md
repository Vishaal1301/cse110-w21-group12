- are you sure you want to stop option
- question mark on the bottom to go over directions
- input real audio

- task list: when we pick a task to focus, it shouldnt be able to get crossed out
- task list: delete task, the list needs to shift 
- taks list: when you cross things off, then refresh it to uncheck, theres still a strikethrough
- tasks list: referesh glitches the clock for a split second making it default 25
- task list: session between break and the next pom.... if we are in focus, then stop then go back to the original focus sess... if we are in break then we stop then we should go to the next focus session
- task list: after you hit stop after break.. make a pop up are you sure you want to stop break
- task list: after you hit stop after focus, make a pop up are you sure you want to stop pomodoro session
- task list: state in between break and next sess should still show the task list 
- settings: when you updated time it doesnt automatically show on timer its bc we have an event lister on the input arrows
- task list: cant have an empty task item
- settings: should only be able to enter a 2 digit number and 100
- task: if something is checked off then you cant focus it

_Notes about testing:_
- lambda test used for browser testing 5 browsers 2 versions
- code cov 100
- branch 100
- code factor needs to be high
- we're using jest, integration testing
- not linear approach, simultaneous approach
- run unit test as we move from features to testing
- after it's in the testing branch, we will run integration. we already integration so we just gotta test to see if everything works well together
- end to end testing (doing this together)
- manual testing where we go through everything like we're the user

_Deadlines:_
