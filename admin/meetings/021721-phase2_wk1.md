_Announcements from Sanat:_
- Should have all working components by next week
- Integrate code together 
- Finish this before Monday
- Friday: we need to give Sanat an update with our code
- Code pushed by friday to github

_Design Decisions (Alan):_
- Should store each task on local or a list of tasks? 
 - need to iterate through list for it
 - downside of each task independently is that it might clash w other vars in setting
 - wont be slow because max task size is only 12
 - in local storage we just have task label, if its completed it wont be in local storage in the first page
 
_Design Decisions (Kevin):_
- Storing time in local storage?
- When we refresh the page rn, the timer restarts
- If we store the time in local storage then keep the same time when the user comes back, then this would be like the pause feature
- Let's just reset the time back to 25

_New stuff:_
- Push code on Friday
- Spend weekend integrating!
